# Prog8051 Assignment 3 - Vehicle Rental Management System
This project is a .NET console-based application that provides memory-stored data (i.e., transient state) and emulates a basic vehicle rental system.

## Setup
This application was originally developed on a Windows 11 platform using .NET 8.0. To run it, you need to have .NET installed (Visual Studio 2022 is recommended). Use dotnet build and `dotnet run` to build and run the application.

## Running the app
Once copied to a local machine, the standard way to run it is by:
1. Open the console terminal (i.e., PowerShell);
2. Make the Project folder your current folder (`cd [X:]\[path to the project]`)
3. Make the `./VehicleManagementSystem` subfolder your current folder (`cd ./VehicleManagementSystem`);
4. Execute `dotnet run`

## Using the app
The application features an intuitive menu and feedback messages. The default option is highlighted between brackets and is typically 0.
